This model mainly focuses on dealing with imbalanced Data and Balanced Data
Firstly we train the model on the imbalanced Data using several Models and compare
the Recall, Accuracy and F1 Score.
Then we balanced the data, by dropping records instead of Augmenting Data
Then we train this new balanced data on the same models used earlier to train the 
initial data and compare the Recall, Accuracy and F1 Score.
We observe a SIGNIFICANT increase in the F1 score of the balanced data
